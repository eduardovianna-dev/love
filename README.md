It includes animations, timed messages, transitions and a light game-like progression designed to create an emotional, surprising experience for the user.

## 📌 Notes

This project was designed **specifically for a personal purpose**, so:
- The text is in Portuguese  
- The emotional flow is tailored to one person  
- Some variables and messages follow this intention  

Even so, the project remains a good demonstration of:
- JS logic  
- UI/UX with emotional pacing  
- Timing and scene switching  
- Clean front-end structure
